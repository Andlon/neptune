neptune
=======

neptune is a hobby game project whose existence is motivated by the following:

- It is an interesting project through which to learn the programming language Rust.
- It serves as a way to learn the fundamentals of 3D programming, including the programmable OpenGL pipeline.
- The game engine is built from scratch specifically for the project, and thus serves as a primer in game engine architecture, which exhibits interesting patterns that are useful outside of game programming.
- The project can be taken in multiple directions depending on the motivation of its contributors. For example, as we have a background in physics, we are particularly interested in the simulation of physical phenomena, and perhaps leveraging these as core gameplay elements.

In its current form, neptune is nothing but some simple geometries moving in 3D space. As the project (hopefully) progresses, this README will eventually be updated.
